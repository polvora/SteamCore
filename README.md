# SteamCore

_If you see a bug, want to add a new feature or want me to make a change, you should create an issue [here](https://github.com/polvora/SteamCore/issues/new)._

Sourcemod natives that extends the functionality of Pawn to interact with common Steam functions.

This is not an actual plugin, it's a library for other plugins to work and it doesn't interact directly with players in servers.

## For Server Owners
SteamCore makes use of an account to send requests to Steam server as a normal user would do. Create a new Steam account, **login on a Steam client and deactivate Steam Guard**. 

**You should not use your personal account for this, it could be flagged as a spam bot.**

### Cvars
#### Mandatory
* `sc_username` Steam account user.  
* `sc_password` Steam account password.

_Use alphanumeric user/pass, max length: 32 characters._

#### Alternative
* `sc_debug` Toggles debug mode _(Default = 0)_.

### Install
#### Requirements
* [A working version of Sourcemod](http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php).
* [SteamWorks extension](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=229556).

To install just copy `steamcore.smx` to the `plugins` folder in your Sourcemod directory.

### Download
Compiled versions: [steamcore.smx][1].

[1]: https://github.com/polvora/SteamCore/releases

If you want to compile the code yourself, you must use the offline compiler, and copy `steamcore.sp`, `steamcore/bigint.sp` and `steamcore/rsa.sp` to the scripting folder in your Sourcemod directory, also you need to copy the include file from SteamWorks to scripting/include.

## For Scripts Writers
You must add `steamcore.inc` inside your `include` folder in order to use SteamCore natives.

### Natives
Also available on `steamcore.inc`.

### Internal Processing of a Request
Natives names and parameters are self-explanatory, but you can first understand the internal processing of a request:

- When a request is made, SteamCore will first check if another request is being executed, if true, the callback function will be _almost automatically_ called (0.1 seconds delay) with `errorCode = 1`. If there is no another request being executed it will continue to the next step.

- Checking the Steam login status, if it's logged out it means a previous attempt to login has failed, a previous request returned a auth error, or 50 minutes have passed since the last login. 

    - If the server is logged in, SteamCore will automatically execute your request.

    - If the server is logged out, SteamCore will first attempt to login and then execute the request.

- Request is executed and callback is called.

    - If the request is successful an `errorCode = 0` will be returned.

    - if the request fails it can be for any reason that will be reflected in the `errorCode`. If the reason is an auth failure, next time a request is made the plugin will try to login before executing the request.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

* SteamCore automatically tries to login on map changes.
    * This only happens 10 minutes after the last login has elapsed, this is to prevent Steam login spam on consecutive map changes.

*  **LOGGING IN CAN FREEZE THE SERVER FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND** (usually < 0.5 seconds) since a long algorithm is executed ([RSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))) in order to encrypt the login information.

* When retrying a request for a second time, a login attempt will  **always** be executed before the request.

* It's possible that SteamCore fails a request when believing that it's logged in and it is not, this usually happens when an user logs out the Steam account from a web browser, therefore ending any active session on that account.

### Demo Code
A very basic working code:

	#include <steamcore>
	
    new String:groupID = "7376325";
    
    public OnPluginStart()
    {
        RegAdminCmd("sm_announce", cmdAnnounce, ADMFLAG_CONFIG, "");
    }

    public Action:cmdAnnounce(client, args)
    {
        decl String:announcement[256];
        GetCmdArgString(announcement, sizeof(announcement));
        SteamGroupAnnouncement(client, announcement, "\n", groupID, myCallback);
    }
    public myCallback(client, bool:success, errorCode, any:data)
    {
        if (success) PrintToChat(client, "Success!!!");
        else PrintToChat(client, "Failure :(");
    }
